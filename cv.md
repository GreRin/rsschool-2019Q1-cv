I wanna mentioned that I studied like a full-time student and I seek of aducation. Had a brake. Founded pretty quiet good job. But time flows and I became understand that I don't like my job. I don't see a result of job. The same mountains of papers every year, nothing useful for people, nothing new. No development. That little story how I decided start learning something new. So my view pointed out on frontend-developer like work wich helps me self-actualize, making progress in my life, become usefull for comunity.
